 * A link to the hive's own read-only dashboard snapshot.
 *
 * This is a link and not an `<iframe>`, and that is not a preference.
 * The hive serves every route through one security middleware
 * (`v2/pkg/dashboard/server.go:securityHeaders`, and the same in
 * `v2/proxy/server.js`) which sets:
 *
 *     X-Frame-Options: DENY
 *     Content-Security-Policy: … frame-ancestors 'none'
 *
 * unconditionally, with no per-route exemption and no configuration knob.
 * Verified against the live instance on 2026-08-08. A browser will refuse to
 * render it in a frame, so an embed would be a blank box.
 *
 * The alternatives are worse than a link: the JSON APIs under /api/ require a
 * session and answer 302 to an anonymous request, and re-hosting the page
 * server-side would mean stripping the hive's own security headers and serving
 * a stale copy of live data under our origin.
 *
 * Tracked upstream as kubestellar/hive#3014. When framing is allowed for this
 * origin, this component becomes the iframe.
