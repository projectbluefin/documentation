/**
 * Fetches weekly countme data from the Fedora countme totals CSV and writes
 * static/data/countme-history.json, consumed by the site to show active-device
 * trends for Bluefin, Bluefin LTS, Aurora, Bazzite, and Fedora.
 *
 * COUNTING RULE — keep in step with ublue-os/countme.
 *
 * ublue-os/countme is the project's canonical countme implementation; it
 * produces the growth_*.svg charts embedded on /analytics and the "Active Users"
 * badges carried in project READMEs. This script exists only because those
 * outputs are a rendered chart and a single latest number, and the dashboard
 * needs the weekly series as data. It must therefore agree with them, so the
 * rules below are ported from ublue-os/countme:data_processing.py rather than
 * invented here. If that file changes, change this one.
 *
 *   1. Drop sys_age == -1. Those rows are not an "all ages" subtotal — they are
 *      a separate legacy unique-IP estimate that mirrors-countme computes in a
 *      second pass and writes into the same table. Adding them to the real
 *      sys_age 1..4 rows stacks two different metrics on top of each other.
 *   2. Count one repo per system. DNF sends countme once per week for each repo
 *      that has it enabled, so `hits` counts requests, not machines. Restricting
 *      to the base ^fedora-[0-9]+$ repo picks the one repo every Fedora-based
 *      system has exactly one of; summing across those tags therefore sums
 *      across releases (F41 + F42 + …), not across repos of one machine.
 *   3. Bluefin LTS is exempt from rule 2. It is CentOS Stream based and has no
 *      fedora-N repo at all, so it is counted across its own (EPEL) repos.
 *   4. Two upstream weeks are known bad and are skipped outright.
 *
 * The source CSV is ~600 MB. This script uses HTTP Range requests to fetch only
 * the trailing window (default 12 MB ≈ 6 weeks), then merges the fresh data
 * with any previously-seeded history so the file grows over time.
 *
 * Degradation: a failed fetch produces an explicit unavailable:true +
 * stateReason payload. This script never throws, never exits non-zero, and
 * never writes a silently empty file. No private or internal URLs are emitted.
 *
 * Cache TTL: 24 hours (override with COUNTME_CACHE_HOURS), bypassed with
 * --force. Use --seed for a one-time wider backfill (5× the window).
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/fetch-countme.js [--force] [--seed]
