{"id":"bluefin-docs-6gd","title":"Simplify bot activity table in monthly reports","description":"## Problem\n\nThe bot activity table in monthly reports showed separate rows for each bot+repository combination, making the section verbose and difficult to scan. For example, renovate-bot activity was split across 6+ separate rows (one per monitored repo), even though users primarily care about total bot contributions.\n\n## Solution Implemented\n\n**Simplified the bot activity table** to aggregate by bot username across all repositories:\n\nBefore (verbose):\n```\n| Bot Username | Repository | PRs Merged |\n|--------------|------------|------------|\n| renovate-bot | bluefin    | 42         |\n| renovate-bot | bluefin-dx | 18         |\n| renovate-bot | common     | 23         |\n```\n\nAfter (aggregated):\n```\n| Bot Username | Total PRs | Repositories Active In |\n|--------------|-----------|------------------------|\n| renovate-bot | 83        | 6 repos               |\n```\n\n**Key Changes:**\n\n1. Aggregated bot activity by bot username (not by bot+repo combination)\n2. Added \"Total PRs\" column showing sum across all repositories\n3. Added \"Repositories Active In\" column showing count of unique repos\n4. Removed per-repository breakdown to reduce noise\n5. Maintained sorting by total PR count (most active bots first)\n\n**Implementation:**\n\nModified `scripts/lib/markdown-generator.mjs`:\n- Updated `generateBotSection()` function\n- Changed aggregation logic to group by bot username only\n- Updated table headers and column formatting\n- Preserved bot filtering logic (same bot detection patterns)\n\n## Impact\n\n- **Reduced verbosity:** Bot section now typically 3-5 rows instead of 15-20\n- **Improved readability:** At-a-glance view of bot activity\n- **Maintained accuracy:** No data loss, just better aggregation\n\n## Validation\n\nRegenerated existing reports (December 2024, January 2025) and verified:\n- Bot PR counts match original data\n- Repository counts are accurate\n- Table renders correctly in markdown\n\n## References\n\n- Markdown generator: `scripts/lib/markdown-generator.mjs`\n- Bot detection patterns: `scripts/lib/contributor-tracker.mjs`\n\n---\n*Migrated from .planning/todos/done/2026-01-27-simplify-bot-activity-table.md*\n*Status: COMPLETED - This work was already implemented*","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"jorge.castro@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-31T00:37:35.930116746-05:00","created_by":"Jorge O.

{"id":"bluefin-docs-e33","title":"Add Community Engagement section to monthly reports","description":"## Problem\n\nMonthly reports currently show contributors by PR authorship only (merged PRs). This misses valuable community engagement from:\n- Discussion participants (comments, reactions, helpful answers)\n- Issue reporters and triagers\n- Code reviewers\n- Community support providers\n\nWe want a \"Community Engagement\" section alongside the existing contributors section that highlights top community participants based on broader engagement metrics.\n\n## Key Research Questions\n\n1. **What metrics to track?**\n   - Discussion comments/replies\n   - Issue comments (excluding PR comments)\n   - Reactions given/received\n   - Helpful answer marks in discussions\n   - Code review comments\n\n2. **Top 10 or Top 20?**\n   - Depends on activity volume in monitored repos\n   - Need to query live data to determine typical engagement levels\n   - Should avoid showing mostly zeros\n\n3. **New Light subsection?**\n   - Similar to \"🌟 New Contributors\" for first-time PR authors\n   - Could show \"🌟 New Voices\" for first-time discussion/issue participants\n   - Would require historical tracking similar to contributors-history.json\n\n4. **Data sources:**\n   - GitHub Discussions API (projectbluefin/common, ublue-os/bluefin)\n   - GitHub Issues API (all monitored repos)\n   - GitHub Pull Request Review API (all monitored repos)\n\n## Solution\n\n**Phase 1: Research \u0026 Design**\n\n1. Query live GitHub API data for December 2024 and January 2025 (existing report months)\n2. Analyze engagement patterns:\n   - How many unique discussion participants per month?\n   - How many unique issue commenters (non-PR)?\n   - What's the distribution? (Are there 5 active people or 50?)\n3. Determine appropriate threshold:\n   - If 5-15 active: Top 10\n   - If 15-30 active: Top 20\n   - If \u003c5 active: May not be worth separate section\n\n**Phase 2: Implementation**\n\n1. Add GraphQL queries for:\n   - Discussion comments in date range\n   - Issue comments (non-PR) in date range\n   - PR review comments in date range\n2. Build engagement scoring system:\n   - Weight different activity types (discussion reply \u003e reaction)\n   - Filter out bot accounts\n   - Aggregate by author\n3. Add \"Community Engagement\" section to markdown generator:\n   - Top N most engaged community members\n   - Show engagement type breakdown (discussions, issues, reviews)\n   - Optional \"New Voices\" subsection for first-timers\n4. Update historical tracking:\n   - Either extend contributors-history.json to include engagement\n   - Or create separate engagement-history.json\n   - Ensure query-based detection like contributor system\n\n**Phase 3: Validation**\n\n1. Generate test reports with engagement data\n2. Verify bot filtering works correctly\n3. Confirm \"New Voices\" detection is accurate\n4.

{"id":"bluefin-docs-itu","title":"Add homebrew tap promotion section to monthly reports","description":"## Problem\n\nMonthly reports should include a section showing packages that have been promoted from the experimental-tap to the production-tap during the reporting period. This helps users discover newly production-ready packages.\n\nThe section should:\n- Appear in monthly reports (not in command-line documentation)\n- List packages promoted during the month with descriptions\n- Include a link to http://github.com/ublue-os/homebrew-tap\n- Use specific wording: \"Use `ujust bbrew` to browse and install these packages. Follow [the tap instructions] if you want to do it by hand.\"\n\n## Solution\n\n**Research Promotions Workflow:**\n1. Identify how packages move from experimental-tap to homebrew-tap\n2. Determine what commit messages/patterns indicate a promotion\n3. Example: commit `bd381cf` (Jan 12, 2026) promoted antigravity-linux\n\n**Add Data Fetching to Report Generator:**\n1. Query both experimental-tap and homebrew-tap repositories\n2. Compare commits between taps to detect promotions\n3. Filter commits by date range (report month)\n4. Extract package names and descriptions from formulas/casks\n\n**Add Markdown Generation:**\n1. Create new section in `scripts/lib/markdown-generator.mjs`\n2. Format: \"## Homebrew Tap Promotions\" section\n3. List promoted packages with bullet points\n4. Include package descriptions from formula/cask files\n5. Add footer with usage instructions and tap link\n\n**Integration:**\n1. Wire up in `scripts/generate-report.mjs`\n2. Position section after \"Contributors\" but before footer\n3. Handle case where no promotions occurred (skip section or show \"None this month\")\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n**Promotion Detection Strategy:**\n\nOption 1: GitHub API commits comparison\n- Fetch commits from both repos in date range\n- Look for new files added to homebrew-tap/Formula or homebrew-tap/Casks\n- Cross-reference with experimental-tap to confirm they existed there first\n\nOption 2: Commit message parsing\n- Look for specific commit patterns like \"feat: promote X to main tap\"\n- Simpler but less reliable if commit messages aren't consistent\n\n**Package Description Extraction:**\n- Parse Ruby formula files to extract `desc` field\n- Example: `desc \"Antigravity application for Linux\"`\n- Cache descriptions to avoid repeated parsing\n\n**Known Promotions (for testing):**\n- antigravity-linux (Jan 12, 2026 - commit bd381cf)\n- goose-linux (frequent updates, check if promotion or just updates)\n- linux-mcp-server (Jan 26, 2026 - commit 90a8c88)\n\n## Files Modified\n- scripts/generate-report.mjs\n- scripts/lib/markdown-generator.mjs\n- reports/\n\n## Success Criteria\n- [ ] Report generator detects promotions from experimental to production tap\n- [ ] Promotions section appears in monthly reports when promotions occurred\n- [ ] Package descriptions accurately extracted from formula files\n- [ ] Section omitted or shows \"None this month\" when no promotions\n- [ ] Usage instructions and tap link included\n- [ ] Test with January 2026 report (known promotions: antigravity, linux-mcp-server)\n\n---\n*Migrated from .planning/todos/pending/2026-01-29-add-homebrew-tap-promotion-section.md (created: 2026-01-29)*","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"jorge.castro@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-31T00:37:06.083488312-05:00","created_by":"Jorge O.

The project currently specifies:\n- `package.json` engines: `\"node\": \"\u003e=18.0\"`\n- Monthly reports workflow: `node-version: \"18\"`\n- Other workflows mix Node 20 and \"latest\"\n\nContinuing to use EOL Node versions creates security and compatibility risks:\n- No security patches for vulnerabilities\n- Incompatibility with newer dependencies\n- CI/CD failures as actions drop Node 18 support\n- Package managers may deprecate Node 18 in their own tooling\n\nThe inconsistency across workflows (18 in monthly-reports, 20 in pages/driver-versions, latest in renovate) suggests the upgrade was partially done but not completed.\n\n## Solution\n\n**Recommended:** Upgrade to Node.js 22 LTS (Active LTS as of October 2024, supported until April 2027)\n\n**Upgrade Plan:**\n\n1. **Update Configuration Files:**\n   - `package.json`: Change engines to `\"node\": \"\u003e=22.0\"`\n   - `.github/workflows/monthly-reports.yml`: Change to `node-version: \"22\"`\n   - Standardize all workflows to use Node 22\n\n2. **Test Locally:**\n   - Switch to Node 22: `nvm use 22` or equivalent\n   - Clear node_modules: `rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json`\n   - Reinstall: `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`\n   - Run validation suite:\n     - `npm run typecheck`\n     - `npm run prettier-lint`\n     - `npm run build`\n     - `npm run generate-report -- --month=2026-01`\n   - Test dev server: `npm start`\n\n3. **Verify All Workflows:**\n   - Trigger each workflow manually via GitHub Actions\n   - Verify monthly reports generation still works\n   - Check driver versions update workflow\n   - Validate pages deployment\n\n4. **Update Documentation:**\n   - `AGENTS.md`: Update Node version references (currently mentions 18.x)\n   - `.planning/STATE.md`: Update technical notes section\n   - Update any installation docs\n\n5. **Commit Strategy:**\n   - Single atomic commit with all version bumps\n   - Test in CI before merging\n   - Monitor first production build after merge\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- Low risk: Node 22 is LTS and Docusaurus 3.8.1 supports it\n- Potential issues: Dependency peer warnings (already using --legacy-peer-deps)\n- Mitigation: Full test suite before commit\n\n**Alternative:** Node 20 LTS (Maintenance mode, supported until April 2026)\n- Safer short-term option if Node 22 causes issues\n- Would require another upgrade in ~12 months\n\n## Files Modified\n- package.json:9-10\n- .github/workflows/monthly-reports.yml:31\n- .github/workflows/pages.yml\n- .github/workflows/update-driver-versions.yml\n\n## References\n- Node.js release schedule: https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases\n- Docusaurus system requirements: https://docusaurus.io/docs/installation#requirements\n\n---\n*Migrated from .planning/todos/pending/2026-01-28-upgrade-node-18-to-latest-lts.md (created: 2026-01-28)*","notes":"PARTIAL COMPLETION FOUND:\n- ✅ All GitHub Actions workflows upgraded to Node 20\n  - pages.yml: node-version: 20\n  - monthly-reports.yml: node-version: \"20\"\n  - update-driver-versions.yml: node-version: \"20\"\n- ❌ package.json engines field still shows: \"node\": \"\u003e=18.0\"\n\nREMAINING WORK:\n- Update package.json engines to require Node 20+\n- Update any documentation mentioning Node 18\n- Test local builds with Node 20\n- Update AGENTS.md if it references Node version","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","owner":"jorge.castro@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-31T00:36:30.816680601-05:00","created_by":"Jorge O.
