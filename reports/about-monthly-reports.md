# About Monthly Reports

Welcome to Monthly Reports! This section tracks Project Bluefin's development activity, completed work, and contributor highlights from [todo.projectbluefin.io](https://todo.projectbluefin.io).

## What's in a report?

Each monthly report includes:

- **Completed work** from the project board (issues and pull requests moved to "Done")
- **Contributor highlights** recognizing everyone who contributed during the month
- **Focus areas** showing activity organized by project area (Desktop, Development, Ecosystem, Hardware, Infrastructure)
- **Work by type** categorizing items as bug fixes, enhancements, documentation, tech debt, or automation
- **New contributors** welcoming first-time contributors with profile cards

## Report Schedule

Reports are published automatically on the **first Monday of each month**, covering all activity from the previous month. The automation:

- Fetches data from the project board via GitHub Actions
- Filters items moved to "Done" status during the month
- Categorizes work by labels (area/_ and kind/_)
- Tracks contributor participation and identifies new contributors
- Generates markdown reports with badges and links

## Looking for OS releases?

These reports track **project activity and development progress**. For **OS release notes and version updates**, check out the [Changelogs](/changelogs) page.

For **announcements and deep dives**, visit the [Blog](/blog).
