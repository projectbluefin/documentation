description: Post a blog post
---

- Use the github API to do all tasks instead os scraping the web
- Under no circumstance do you touch any files other than the blog file and the authors.yaml (optional) - do NOT touch anything else
- Take a github issue or github discussion that is assigned to you and post it as a @docusaurus blog post.
  - Always follow the best practices by the upstream documentation
- Always link to the github discussions of the topic so that each blog post links to the originating github discussion
- Ensure the tags on the blog post are relevant and follow the pattern of the rest of the blog
- Ensure you link to every repository mentioned, use the `@projectname/repo` pattern when referring to other repositories
- Ensure the major projects mentioned have hyperlinks to their upstream projects
- Do NOT modify the content itself, you are adding links and a convenience to the authore, you do NOT add any opinion to the content
- Auto add the person to authors.yaml if the author is not included
- Ensure all images are reformatted to use the `![Description](https://githurl)` format so that they show up in proper @docusaurus formatting
