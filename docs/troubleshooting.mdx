> "Ask Bluefin", is a custom operating system agent. For you new users, a system designed to help you learn Linux, without the toil of digging through the internet or being told that you installed the wrong Linux distribution. "Ask Bluefin" is trained on the operating system and its documentation, so it's always learning from the source of truth and tweaked by the community. For you Linux veterans, a power diagnostic tool for your local PC, with built in integration to your servers and cluster ...

In the menu select "Ask Bluefin" to use the chat agent.

### Installation

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
  <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux" default>
    ```bash brew install ublue-os/experimental-tap/linux-mcp-server ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="macos" label="macOS">
    ```bash brew install ublue-os/experimental-tap/linux-mcp-server ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

This installs linux-mcp-server + the goose client + our config, follow the instructions in the terminal. TODO:

- onboarding process
- "Bring your own LLM": Select whatever combo of commercial and local AI they can via goose's providers
- Local setup goes to:
  - Ramalama config and service unit
  - Choice of local model
- A [docs2db setup](https://github.com/rhel-lightspeed/docs2db) preloaded with Bluefin's documentation

Now that Ask Bluefin is setup it can automate tasks for you like "Manually update this computer for me."

> Some other common examples

## Basic System Things

- "What kind of computer is this?"
- "How do I get started with Podman?"
- [Add]

## Automated Troubleshooting

You can ask the tool things about your system using natural language:

### 💡 Pro Tips

- **Combine Tools:** You don't need to ask for one thing at a time.
  > "Check CPU usage and show me the top 5 processes."
- **Filter Logs:** Be specific with time and priority to save context window.

  > "Show me `error` priority logs from the last `30 minutes`."

- **Remote Hosts:** If you configured SSH, just ask to run on a specific host.
  > "Check disk usage on `webserver1`."
