### Hardware

Bluefin GDX runs great on any PC with the right hardware, but has been tested and known to work on:

- [Thelio Astra](https://system76.com/desktops/thelio-astra-a1.1-n1/configure) - Find these Ampere-powered monsters at an open source conference near you!

:::tip[AMD user?]

This image is for Nvidia hardware, using [Bluefin LTS](/lts) and turning on [developer mode](/bluefin-dx) is the recommended path for AMD systems. All AI/ML tools and improvements are brought to Bluefin's developer mode.
