# Monthly Reports

Monthly reports provide transparent, data-driven summaries of completed work, active contributors, and project momentum from the [Bluefin Project Board](https://todo.projectbluefin.io).

## What Are Monthly Reports?

Monthly reports are automatically generated each month, summarizing:

- **Completed Work:** Items moved to "Done" on the project board, categorized by area and type
- **Contributors:** Everyone who contributed during the period, with special recognition for first-time contributors
- **Bot Activity:** Automated dependency updates and maintenance tasks
- **Project Status:** ChillOps philosophy indicators for each project area

Reports are published monthly covering the previous month's activity.

## ChillOps Philosophy

Bluefin follows a "ChillOps" development philosophy:

- **No artificial urgency:** Work progresses at sustainable pace
- **Quality over velocity:** Thoughtful development beats rushed releases
- **Community-driven:** Contributors work on what interests them
- **Transparent:** All work visible on public project board

When a project area shows "Status: ChillOps" in reports, it means work is progressing steadily without pressure or burnout.

## Supply Chain Notes in Changelogs

Changelog cards now include a **Supply Chain** block when a release contains commit subjects related to SBOMs, attestations, or provenance tooling updates.

- The signal is derived from release commit entries (for example, references to SBOM generation, attest workflows, `cosign`, `oras`, or `syft` changes).
- It is designed as a fast indicator for users tracking release integrity changes without reading every commit line.
- LTS changelog cards include the same section now, and will begin showing entries as LTS SBOM/provenance commits land.
- Cards now include a direct link to the matching GHCR package tag view in GitHub, which is the easiest path to inspect signatures and related supply-chain artifacts.
- For full release context, open the linked release and commit details from each changelog card.

### Bot Activity

Automated maintenance tasks performed by bots:

- Dependency updates (Dependabot, Renovate)
- Automated builds and tests
- Version bumps

Shown separately from human contributions to highlight community work.

### Contributors

Recognition for everyone who contributed:

- GitHub usernames with profile links
- First-time contributors highlighted with profile cards
- Tracked across all Bluefin repositories

## How Reports Differ from Changelogs and Blog

Understanding the content types:

| Content Type   | Purpose                                | Frequency   | Source                   |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------ |
| **Changelogs** | OS release notes with package versions | Per release | GitHub Releases          |
| **Blog Posts** | Deep dives, announcements, tutorials   | Ad-hoc      | Manual authoring         |
| **Reports**    | Project activity summaries             | Monthly     | Project board automation |

**Use changelogs** to see what changed in a specific OS release.  
They now also include supply-chain-related highlights when present in release commits.  
**Use blog posts** for detailed explanations and guides.  
**Use reports** to track project momentum and contributor activity.

- **Website:** Browse all reports at [/reports](/reports)
- **RSS Feed:** Subscribe at [/reports/rss.xml](pathname:///reports/rss.xml)
- **Navigation:** Access via "Reports" link in main navigation

## Automated Generation

Reports are 100% automatically generated from the project board:

1. Monthly on the last day of the month at 10:00 UTC
2. GitHub Actions workflow fetches project board data
3. Script categorizes completed items by labels
4. Markdown report generated and committed
5. Site rebuilds and deploys automatically

No manual curation or editing. What you see reflects actual project board state.
