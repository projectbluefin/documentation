# Giscus Discussions

## When to Use

Use this procedure after publishing a Bluefin blog post when:

- the `Open Discussion on New Blog Post` workflow fails, or succeeds without
  creating a Discussion;
- the post’s Giscus comment area cannot find its Discussion;
- an existing draft Discussion must point readers to the published post.

## When NOT to Use

Do not use this procedure to change the Giscus component, its repository,
mapping, category, or styling. Do not create a Discussion for a draft post, and
do not archive the source Discussion before the published post and its comment
Discussion are both verified.

## Core Process

1. Confirm the post is live at
   `https://docs.projectbluefin.io/blog/<slug>/` and that its HTML includes
   `giscus`.
2. Inspect the matching `Open Discussion on New Blog Post` workflow run, and
   read its log rather than its conclusion. A missing
   `BLUEFIN_DISCUSSIONS_TOKEN` does not turn the run red: the job logs
   `BLUEFIN_DISCUSSIONS_TOKEN is not configured` and exits green, so that an
   unprovisioned secret never blocks `main`. A green run carrying that line
   created no Discussion. The normal fix is to restore the existing
   `BLUEFIN_DISCUSSIONS_TOKEN` repository secret with Discussion write access
   in `ublue-os/bluefin`, then rerun the workflow, which activates the feature
   with no code change. Do not create a replacement token, GitHub App, or
   credential scheme.
3. Search `ublue-os/bluefin` for the exact title
   `<post title> | Bluefin`. If it already exists, verify its body contains the
   expected SHA-1 marker and do not create a duplicate.
4. If the post is live, the workflow cannot run with its existing secret, and
   an authorized maintainer must recover the thread immediately, use GitHub
   GraphQL with the maintainer’s existing authenticated `gh` account. Obtain
   the repository and category IDs from
   `src/components/GiscusComments/index.tsx`; they are the source of truth for
   the configured Giscus target.
5. Create the Discussion with the exact title `<post title> | Bluefin` and a
   body containing:

   ```md
   A new blog post is up: **[<post title>](https://docs.projectbluefin.io/blog/<slug>)**

   Read it and join the conversation below! 🦕

   <!-- sha1: <sha1 of "<post title> | Bluefin"> -->
   ```

   Calculate the marker from the complete title, including the spaces around
   the vertical bar:

   ```sh
   printf %s '<post title> | Bluefin' | sha1sum
   ```

   GitHub’s documented `createDiscussion` mutation requires `repositoryId`,
   `categoryId`, `title`, and `body`:

   ```graphql
   mutation (
     $repositoryId: ID!
     $categoryId: ID!
     $title: String!
     $body: String!
   ) {
     createDiscussion(
       input: {
         repositoryId: $repositoryId
         categoryId: $categoryId
         title: $title
         body: $body
       }
     ) {
       discussion {
         id
         url
       }
     }
   }
   ```

6. Query the created Discussion and confirm its exact title, canonical post
   link, SHA-1 marker, and comment count. A count of zero is valid for a new
   post. The marker is required because the site maps Giscus with
   `mapping="og:title"` and `strict="1"`.
7. Query the source Discussion with
   `repository.discussion(number: <number>)` and use the returned GraphQL `id`
   for `updateDiscussion` and `closeDiscussion`. Its REST numeric `id` is not
   accepted by those mutations.
8. Only after the Giscus Discussion is verified, replace the source draft
   Discussion body with links to the live post and comment Discussion, then
   close it. Use GitHub GraphQL `updateDiscussion` and `closeDiscussion`
   mutations when the REST update endpoint is unavailable to the authenticated
   maintainer.

## Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization                                                    | Reality                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| “The workflow failed, but the post is live, so comments can wait.” | A strict Giscus mapping has no discussion to attach to. Create or recover the exact matching Discussion before closing the source thread. |
| “A similar title is close enough.”                                 | Giscus strict mode matches the exact `og:title` hash. Use the blog title and its `Bluefin` suffix exactly.                                |
| “I can make a new token to unblock this.”                          | The supported automation uses `BLUEFIN_DISCUSSIONS_TOKEN`. Restore that secret; do not add another credential scheme.                     |
| “The workflow run is green, so the secret must be configured.”     | The job exits green by design when the secret is absent. Read the log for the skip notice before concluding the automation ran.           |
| “The original discussion can be closed first.”                     | Readers lose the migration path until the post and its comments are both live. Archive it last.                                           |

## Red Flags

- The workflow reports a created Discussion that does not exist in
  `ublue-os/bluefin`. A green run whose log carries the
  `BLUEFIN_DISCUSSIONS_TOKEN is not configured` skip notice is the documented
  unprovisioned-secret path, not a silent success.
- The Giscus title differs from the blog title plus ` | Bluefin`.
- The Discussion body lacks its SHA-1 marker.
- More than one Discussion exists with the exact blog-comment title.
- The source draft Discussion is closed before the live post and comment
  Discussion are verified.

## Verification

- [ ] The live post returns successfully and includes the Giscus integration.
- [ ] Exactly one matching Discussion exists in `ublue-os/bluefin`.
- [ ] Its title, canonical post URL, and SHA-1 marker match the published post.
- [ ] The comment count has been checked; zero is recorded as a valid initial state.
- [ ] The source Discussion links to both the post and Giscus Discussion, then
      is closed.
