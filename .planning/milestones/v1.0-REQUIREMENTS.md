# Requirements: Bluefin Documentation Technical Cleanup

**Defined:** 2026-01-26
**Core Value:** The documentation site must be technically sound and maintainable - all validation passing, no dead code, configuration aligned with Docusaurus standards.

## v1 Requirements

Requirements for technical cleanup completion. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Configuration & Dependencies

- [x] **CONFIG-01**: React 19 peer dependencies resolved using npm overrides (no --legacy-peer-deps flag required)
- [x] **CONFIG-02**: docusaurus.config.ts validated against Docusaurus 3.8.1 official best practices
- [x] **CONFIG-03**: Unused dependencies removed from package.json (audit all 21 dependencies)

### Type System

- [x] **TYPE-01**: src/types/theme.d.ts FeedData interface fixed to match actual useStoredFeed hook structure
- [x] **TYPE-02**: Proper TypeScript interfaces created for auto-generated JSON data (feeds, playlists, GitHub profiles/repos)
- [x] **TYPE-03**: TypeScript strict mode flags enabled incrementally without breaking build
- [x] **TYPE-04**: All `any` types replaced with proper interfaces or type annotations

### Components

- [x] **COMP-01**: TypeScript errors in FeedItems.tsx resolved (after type system fixes)
- [x] **COMP-02**: TypeScript errors in PackageSummary.tsx resolved (after type system fixes)
- [x] **COMP-03**: TypeScript errors in BlogPostItem/index.tsx resolved (JSX namespace error)
- [x] **COMP-04**: All components audited for SSR safety (window/localStorage usage properly guarded)
- [x] **COMP-05**: Three swizzled theme components audited for necessity and documented
- [x] **COMP-06**: Component isolation tests written for critical components (FeedItems, PackageSummary, GitHubProfileCard, ProjectCard)

### Code Quality

- [x] **QUALITY-01**: Dead code removed from 17 TypeScript files identified in audit
- [x] **QUALITY-02**: All validation commands pass without errors (npm run typecheck, npm run prettier-lint, npm run build)
- [x] **QUALITY-03**: ESLint configuration added with @docusaurus/eslint-plugin

## v2 Requirements

Deferred to future work. Tracked but not in current roadmap.

### Configuration & Dependencies

- **CONFIG-04**: Deployment configuration documented as immutable with warnings
- **CONFIG-05**: Build-time data fetching scripts protected with documentation and warnings

### Scripts

- **SCRIPTS-01**: All 11 scripts documented with header comments (purpose, inputs, outputs, error handling)
- **SCRIPTS-02**: Complex scripts simplified (update-driver-versions.js: 464 lines with brittle HTML scraping)

### Testing

- **TEST-01**: Testing framework installed (Vitest recommended for Docusaurus)
- **TEST-02**: Script unit tests for data fetching logic

### Operational

- **OPS-01**: API rate limit handling improved with retry logic and caching

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature                       | Reason                                                   |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Content updates (docs/blog)   | Preserving all existing content - technical cleanup only |
| New features or functionality | Pure cleanup project, not feature development            |
| Performance optimization      | Unless blocking correctness, defer to future work        |
| Accessibility improvements    | Not part of technical debt remediation                   |
| Design or styling changes     | Keep visual presentation unchanged                       |
| Framework migration           | Staying with Docusaurus 3.8.1, not switching frameworks  |
| E2E testing                   | Wrong tool for static site - component tests sufficient  |
| Component rewrites            | Fix-in-place safer and faster than rewrites              |
| Backend services              | Static site pattern, no server-side needed               |
| MDX v3 content syntax fixes   | 49 files may have issues but functional, defer to v2     |

## Milestone Summary

**Shipped:** 16 of 16 v1 requirements (100%)

**Adjusted:** None - all requirements shipped as originally defined

**Dropped:** None - all v1 requirements completed

**Requirement Outcomes:**

All 16 v1 requirements were validated through phase verification reports:

- Phase 1 (CONFIG-01, CONFIG-02, CONFIG-03): Verified in 01-01-VERIFICATION.md
- Phase 2 (TYPE-01, TYPE-02, TYPE-03, TYPE-04): Verified in 02-01-VERIFICATION.md
- Phase 3 (COMP-01, COMP-02, COMP-03, COMP-04, COMP-05, COMP-06): Verified in 03-01-VERIFICATION.md
- Phase 4 (QUALITY-01, QUALITY-02, QUALITY-03): Verified in 04-VERIFICATION.md

**Gap Closure:**

- Phase 4 initial verification (04-01-VERIFICATION.md) identified CI/CD enforcement gap
- Gap closure plan (04-02) added validation gates to GitHub Actions workflow
- Re-verification (04-VERIFICATION.md) confirmed gap closed and all requirements satisfied
