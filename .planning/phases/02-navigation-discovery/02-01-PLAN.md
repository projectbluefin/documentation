<objective>
Integrate reports into site navigation ecosystem through cross-links, intro paragraphs, and consistent footer templates.

Purpose: Make reports discoverable and explain their relationship to existing content (changelogs = OS releases, reports = project activity). Ensure navigation consistency across desktop and mobile.

Output: Updated changelogs page with intro paragraph, markdown generator with footer template, verified navbar order.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Add cross-link intro to changelogs page</name>
  <files>src/pages/changelogs.tsx</files>
  <action>
Update changelogs.tsx to add an intro paragraph explaining the relationship between changelogs and reports.

Current file is minimal (7 lines) and just imports/renders CommunityFeeds component. The CommunityFeeds component likely handles the page layout.

Add intro paragraph BEFORE the CommunityFeeds component:

```tsx
import React from "react";
import CommunityFeeds from "../components/CommunityFeeds";

export default function CommunityFeedsPage(): React.JSX.Element {
  return (
    <>
      <div
        style={{ maxWidth: "800px", margin: "0 auto 2rem", padding: "0 1rem" }}
      >
        <p>
          Looking for project activity and development progress? Check out our{" "}
          <a href="/reports">Biweekly Reports</a> for summaries of completed
          work, contributor highlights, and project board updates.
        </p>
      </div>
      <CommunityFeeds />
    </>
  );
}
```

Wording guidance from CONTEXT.md: "Want to see what we're working on? Check Reports" - but make it natural and conversational. Use your discretion for exact wording (CONTEXT.md says "Claude's Discretion: Exact wording of cross-link intro sections").

Key: Keep it concise (1-2 sentences), prominent (before main content), and clearly explain the complementary relationship (changelogs = OS releases, reports = project activity).
</action>
<verify>
npm run typecheck
npm run build

# Open http://localhost:3000/changelogs and verify intro paragraph is visible

  </verify>
  <done>Changelogs page has intro paragraph with link to /reports explaining their complementary relationship. Build passes TypeScript validation.</done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Add footer template to report markdown generator</name>
  <files>scripts/lib/markdown-generator.js</files>
  <action>
Update markdown-generator.js to add a consistent footer to every generated report.

Locate the `generateReportMarkdown` function. After all the content sections (summary, categorized work, bot activity, contributors), add a footer section before the final return.

Footer template (guidance from CONTEXT.md):

- Links back to changelogs and blog
- Example: "See the [latest changelog](/changelogs) for OS releases, or read our [blog](/blog) for announcements"

Add to the markdown output before return statement:

```javascript
---

*Want to see the latest OS releases? Check out the [Changelogs](/changelogs) page. For announcements and deep dives, read our [Blog](/blog).*

*This report was automatically generated from the [Project Bluefin Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/projectbluefin/projects/2).*
```

Keep it subtle (italics), brief, and informative. The goal is consistent cross-linking without cluttering the report.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Verify navbar order and add reports blog intro</name>
  <files>docusaurus.config.ts</files>
  <action>
Verify navbar order matches specification from CONTEXT.md: Blog, Changelogs, Reports, Discussions, Feedback, Store.

Read docusaurus.config.ts navbar items section (around line 171 based on earlier grep). Check the order of links.

Expected order:

1. Blog
2. Changelogs
3. Reports
4. Discussions
5. Feedback
6. Store (or other right-aligned links like GitHub)

If order is incorrect, reorder the items in the navbar array.

**Also add intro to reports blog homepage:**

Check if the reports blog plugin configuration (id: "reports") has a `blogDescription` field. Update it to be more user-friendly and explain the relationship to changelogs:

```typescript
blogDescription: "Biweekly project activity reports. Looking for OS release notes? See the Changelogs page.",
```

This description appears at the top of /reports homepage and helps first-time visitors understand what reports are vs. changelogs.

**RSS link treatment:**

Check how the main blog handles RSS links (footer, sidebar, etc.). The reports RSS feed is already configured in feedOptions (from Phase 1), so no additional config needed unless there's a specific RSS icon/link in the blog UI that should be matched. Note your findings about RSS link treatment in the verification output.

  <done>Navbar order matches specification. Reports blog description updated with cross-reference to changelogs. Build passes validation.</done>

**End-to-end checks:**

1. Navigate to /changelogs → intro paragraph visible with link to /reports
2. Navigate to /reports → blog description explains relationship to changelogs
3. Generate test report → markdown includes footer with changelogs + blog links
4. Check navbar → order is Blog, Changelogs, Reports, Discussions, Feedback, Store
5. Mobile navigation → hamburger menu shows same order
6. TypeScript compilation passes (0 errors)
7. Build succeeds

**Cross-link verification:**

```bash
# Changelogs intro contains reports link
grep -i "reports" src/pages/changelogs.tsx

# Markdown generator footer contains changelogs + blog links
grep -i "changelogs\|blog" scripts/lib/markdown-generator.js

# Navbar order verification
grep -A20 "navbar.*items" docusaurus.config.ts | grep -i "label.*:"
```

<success_criteria>

- Changelogs page has prominent intro paragraph explaining reports (1-2 sentences)
- Reports blog description references changelogs
- Markdown generator produces footer with changelogs + blog links
- Navbar order matches specification across desktop and mobile
- All TypeScript and build validations pass
- Cross-links are natural, conversational, and explain complementary relationship
